Remote-exec Provisioner

The remote-exec provisioner invokes a script on a remote resource after it is created. This can be used to run a configuration management
tool, bootstrap into a cluster, etc. To invoke a local process, see the local-exec provisioner instead. The remote-exec provisioner supports 
both ssh and winrm type connections.
