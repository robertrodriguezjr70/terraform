local-exec Provisioner
Jump to Section
The local-exec provisioner invokes a local executable after a resource is created.
This invokes a process on the machine running Terraform, not on the resource. See the remote-exec provisioner to run commands on the resource.

Note that even though the resource will be fully created when the provisioner is run, there is no guarantee that it will
be in an operable state - for example system services such as sshd may not be started yet on compute resources.
